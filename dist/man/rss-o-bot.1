.SH ACTIONS
.SS [run]
.P
Run the deamon process in the foreground\.
.SS add \fIurl\fR [\fIfilter\fR\|\.\.\.]
.P
\fI$1\fR a Feed\-URL to the database\. \fIurl\fR is a URL to an Atom or RSS feed\. The URL must include the protocol\. HTTP and HTTPS are supported\. Post\-titles inside a feed will be filtered by the words passed as \fIfilter\fR to \fBadd\fP\|\. \fIfilter\fR can be negated (to check that a title doesn't include a string) by pepending them with a bang (\fB!\fP)\. For example \fBrss\-o\-bot add <url> 'children' '!cooking'\fP\|\. Be carefull to always wrap negated filters in quotes (\fB\|'\fP)\. Otherwise your shell will probably interpret the bang as a keyword\. The filters are matched using "\fIsmartcase\fR" (as in VIM smartcase)\. So if a filter includes no upper\-case letters, it will be matched case\-insensitively\. When it contains an upper\-case letter it will be matched case\-sensitively\.
.SS rm \fIid\fR
.P
Remove a Feed\-URL from the database\. \fIid\fR is the key of a Feed\-URL inside the database\. \fBid\fPs are displayed in \fBrss\-o\-bot list\fP\|\.
.SS list
.P
List all Feed\-URLs, their IDs and their filters\.
.SS test\-notification [\fIurl\fR]
.P
Send a test notification over the defined "notification\-methods"
.SS import \fIpath\fR
.P
OPML import\. Takes a \fIpath\fR to an OPML\-file as a parameter and scanns it for outline elements\. It's standard for RSS clients to provide an OPML export\. These contain outline tags which the importer searches for\. From those tags, the xmlUrl or Url Attributes are read as feed\-URLs\.
.SS export
.P
Exports the RSS feeds as OPML to STDOUT\. The export does not include the defined filters\. Simply beacause, there is no standard way of exporting those\.
.SS poll\-feeds
.P
Triggers a poll of all feeds in the database\.
.SH DEBUGGING
.P
To enter the debugging mode, you'll need to set the \fBDEBUG\fP environment variable to a list including \fBrss\-o\-bot\fP\|\. For example:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
DEBUG=rss\-o\-bot rss\-o\-bot
.fi
.RE
.P
For further information check the debug\-package's docs \fIhttps://www\.npmjs\.com/package/debug\fR\|\. It's the debugging utitlity this tool uses\.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.P
RSS\-o\-Bot checks three places for configuration files\. \fB$HOME/\.rss\-o\-bot\fP, or \fB%USERPROFILE%\\\.rss\-o\-bot\fP on windows, \fB/etc/\.rss\-o\-bot\fP and \fB${__dirname}/config\.json\fP\|\. The last is the root directory of the NPM package\. It is only meant for development puposes\. The files are check for their existance in that order (except for \fBconfig\.json\fP which is checked first)\.
.P
The configuration file should contain a single JSON\-object on the root level\. Use the example configuration inside the README as a reference\. These are the available configuration options:
.SS notification\-methods
.P
An array of methods\. No \fBdefault\fR\|\. When a new item appears in a stream, a notification will be sent over the defined methods\. rss\-o\-bot requires modules named after these methods\. So if you define a method \fB"email"\fP you'll need to \fBnpm i \-g rss\-o\-bot\-email\fP first\. Currenly known notifiers are \fBrss\-o\-bot\-email\fP, \fBrss\-o\-bot\-desktop\fP, \fBrss\-o\-bot\-telegram\fP\|\.
.SS interval
.P
A number in section that defines how often the Feed\-URLs should be polled\. \fBDefaults\fR to 300\.
.SS database
.P
An object containing information on the database\. It must include a \fBname\fP property\. If you're database requires a username and password (non\-SQLite), set these as the \fBusername\fP and \fBpassword\fP properties\. The object must also include a \fBoptions\fP object containing further information on the database connection\. It must at least include a \fBdialect\fP and a \fBstorage\fP attribute\. SQLite is the prefered database here, since it has a very low overhead and high portability\. The \fBoptions\fP object is passed as\-is to Sequelize\. Check its docs \fIhttp://sequelize\.readthedocs\.io/en/latest/api/sequelize/\fR for further information\. The \fBdefault\fR is:
